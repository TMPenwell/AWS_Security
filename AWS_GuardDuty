In today's Tech Talent & Strategy AWS re/Start class, we talked about intrusion detection systems and GuardDuty. There wasn't a lab component in the curriculum but I found a nice substitute with AWS Workshops. I am, admittedly, bad about going through the motions mindlessly when it comes to tutorials unless I make myself something more mindful to do. I don't think I'm alone in that and created guided notes to go along with the workshop which requires a little more time, effort, and mindfulness.
